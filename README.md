#                                                       Startup Unicorn Prediction Using Advanced Machine Learning Algorithms

Abstract : 
Artificial intelligence is an emerging topic and will soon be able to perform decisions better than humans. In more complex and creative contexts such as innovation, however, the question remains whether machines are superior to humans. Machines fail in two kinds of situations: processing and interpreting “soft” information (information that cannot be quantified) and making predictions in “unknowable risk” situations of extreme uncertainty. In such situations, the machine does not have representative information for a certain outcome. Thereby, humans are still the “gold standard” for assessing “soft” signals and make use intuition. To predict the success of startups, we, thus, combine the complementary capabilities of humans and machines in machine learning algorithms like Gradient Boosting, SVM, Random Forest and Decision Tree. All ML algorithms will be trained on past performance of STARTUP dataset and then this trained model can be used to predict success or failure of new STARTUP TEST DATA.
